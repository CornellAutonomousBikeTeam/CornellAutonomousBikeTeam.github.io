# Cornell Autonomous Bicycle Team

Welcome to the guides for Cornell's Autonomous Bicycle Team.

This is meant to be a gentle introduction to the bike(s) on our team and a casual reference to various parts of the bike and issues that we experience. This also includes a more formal introduction to our bike (linked below) that gives some more in-depth explanations of some of the math behind the mechanical phenomena of the bike. If you would like even more knoweldge about our bike, 
our past semesterly papers can be found on our website [here](https://bike.engineering.cornell.edu/papers.html).
