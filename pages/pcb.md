# PCB

## Some Basic Information
So the bike team and CU Sail (Professor Ruina's other project team) have collaborated together to make a custom printed circuit board that can be used by both teams, as there are a high number of common features that both teams need from a PCB. 

## Arduino Due

This is the Arduino. The Arduino communicates with the Raspberry Pi using ROS
so that the bike can communicate data that it receives from the sensors on the
bike and take calculations of what movement the bike should take next. Our team
uses an Arduino Due.

## Power Converter

## LEDs
