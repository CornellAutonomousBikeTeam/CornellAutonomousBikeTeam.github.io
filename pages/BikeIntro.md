# A Gentle Introduction to the Bike

# Basic Parts of the Bike

This is the bike:

So let's get down to the basic parts of the bike:

## Battery

This is our battery. Our batteries have a nominal voltage of 27 V, which means
that their voltage can range from 25-29 V. In order to run on the bike, you want
the voltage to be at least ** V. If it's not, there's a charger underneath the
Record-Breaking Walking Robot - just remember to unplug the battery if you
leave the lab or

## IMU

This is the IMU, which stands for **. The IMU takes a few **, including Euler angles.

### A brief interlude about Euler Angles

There are three directions Euler angles measure: roll, pitch, and yaw.

## Raspberry Pi

## PCB

This is our printed circuit board. The Cornell Autonomous Bike Team and CU Sail
collaborated to specially design this board so that both teams could use it as
we have many similar needs. However, because we do have some different needs,
there will be things on the PCB that our team will not use.

## GPS

## Front Motor

This is our front motor.

## Rear Motor

This is our rear motor.

## Landing Gear

This is our landing gear, named after how planes have landing gear wheels (fun
fact: CUAir does not use landing gear for their planes, as they prefer to just
crash land their plane each time, so we're the only project team that uses
landing gear). They're essentially a pair of fancier training wheels in that
they can lift up and down.

Their purpose is to be able to stabilize the bike while the bike is not in
immediate motion.
