# Steer-By-Wire Bike

"What an unusual name! What does it mean?" 

## Behind the Name

Prior to the 1960s, planes were steered directly. Any turn that the pilot applied to the pilot controls would result in a
direct change to the flight controls. 

In the 1960s, planes began to develop a fly-by-wire system. In this system, when a pilot applies a turn to the pilot controls,
electronic commands were sent to the system that would then determine, based off a combination of internal and external factors, 
how much the flight controls would be moved. 

We have taken that idea and applied it to our steer-by-wire bike. Our steer-by-wire bike takes the user's movement of the 
handlebars and produces a desired steer angle, which is then passed into our system to determine how much to turn our front wheel.

# Goal of the Steer-By-Wire Bike

The eventual goal of the steer-by-wire bike is to create a bicycle in which no matter what the rider does, will not result in the
bike falling over. 

# Breakdown of the Bike

For the most part, the steer-by-wire bike is similar to our current bike.
